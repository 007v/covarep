A Cooperative Voice Analysis Repository for Speech Processing Techniques
                          Version 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Covarep is an open-source repository of advanced speech processing algorithms and stored in a GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/gillesdegottex/covarep">Covarep</a> where researchers in speech processing can store original implementations of published algorithms.</p>

<p>Over the past few decades a vast array of advanced speech processing algorithms have been developed, often offering significant improvements over the existing state-of-the-art. Such algorithms can have a reasonably high degree of complexity and, hence, can be difficult to accurately re-implement based on article descriptions. Another issue is the so-called 'bug magnet effect' with re-implementations frequently having significant differences from the original ones. The consequence of all this has been that many promising developments have been under-exploited or discarded, with researchers tending to stick to conventional analysis methods.</p>

<p>By developing Covarep we are hoping to address this by encouraging authors to include original implementations of their algorithms, thus resulting in a single de facto version for the speech community to refer to.</p>

<p>We envisage a range of benefits to the repository:</p>

<p>1) Reproducible research: USpeech will allow fairer comparison of algorithms in published articles.</p>

<p>2) Encouraged usage: the free availability of these algorithms will encourage researchers from a wide range of speech-related disciplines to exploit them for their own applications.</p>

<p>3) Feedback: as a GitHub project users will be able to offer comments on algorithms, report bugs, suggest improvements etc.</p>

<h3>
<a name="scope" class="anchor" href="#scope"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h3>

<p>We welcome contributions from a wide range of speech processing areas, including (but not limited to): Speech analysis, synthesis, conversion, transformation, enhancement, glottal source/voice quality analysis, etc.</p>

<h3>
<a name="contribute" class="anchor" href="#contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contribute!</h3>

<p>We believe that the USpeech repository has a great potential benefit to the speech research community and we hope that you will consider contributing your published algorithms to it. If you have any questions, comments issues etc regarding Covarep please contact us on one of the email addresses below. Please forward this email to others who may be interested.</p>

<p>Please also have a look at the Covarep.pdf document in the documentation directory for more information.</p>
