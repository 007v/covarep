<a name="aim" class="anchor" href="#aim"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aim</h3>

<p>Covarep is an open-source repository of advanced speech processing algorithms and stored in a GitHub project where researchers in speech processing can store original implementations of published algorithms.</p>

<p>Over the past few decades a vast array of advanced speech processing algorithms have been developed, often offering significant improvements over the existing state-of-the-art. Such algorithms can have a reasonably high degree of complexity and, hence, can be difficult to accurately re-implement based on article descriptions. Another issue is the so-called 'bug magnet effect' with re-implementations  requently having significant differences from the original ones. The consequence of all this has been that many promising developments have been under-exploited or discarded, with researchers tending to stick to conventional analysis methods.</p>

<p>By developing Covarep we are hoping to address this by encouraging authors to include original implementations of their algorithms, thus resulting in a single de facto version for the speech community to refer to.</p>

<p>We envisage a range of benefits to the repository:</p>

<p><strong>Reproducible research</strong>: Covarep will allow fairer comparison of algorithms in published articles.</p>

<p><strong>Encouraged usage</strong>: the free availability of these algorithms will encourage researchers from a wide range of speech-related disciplines to exploit them for their own applications.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback</strong>: as a GitHub project users will be able to offer comments on algorithms, report bugs, suggest improvements etc.</p>

<h3>
<a name="scope" class="anchor" href="#scope"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h3>

<p>We welcome contributions from a wide range of speech processing areas, including (but not limited to): Speech analysis, synthesis, conversion, transformation, enhancement, glottal source/voice quality analysis, etc.</p>


<p>Please also have a look at the <a href="https://raw.github.com/covarep/covarep/master/documentation/Covarep.pdf">Covarep.pdf</a> document in the documentation directory for more information.</p>

<a name="cite" class="anchor" href="#cite"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to cite</h3>
<p>
If you publish experiment results obtained by using Covarep, please cite the repository using the following publication:<blockquote>G. Degottex, J. Kane, T. Drugman, T. Raitio and S. Scherer, "COVAREP - A collaborative voice analysis repository for speech technologies", In Proc. IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Florence, Italy 2014.</blockquote>
</br>
Also, within the text of your paper, please mention the version used. For example, assuming the Covarep reference is the 12th:<blockquote> ... we compared with methods X, Y, Z, available in [12](v1.0.1).</blockquote>
